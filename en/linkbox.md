# LinkBox

## 📖 Detailed overview

The LinkBox primitive is used for:

- creating a link to other pages;
- creating a link to parts within the current or another page (anchor link);
- creating a link to open files;
- creating a link to write an email;
- creating a link with a phone number.

In the LinkBox properties, you can set the target address, the tab
behavior when you click the link, the LinkBox behavior when transferring
lines and when overflowing.

The difference between Link and LinkBox is that LinkBox is a container where other
elements can be placed. These elements together will work as a link. For example,
LinkBox is perfect for cards that link to another page.
